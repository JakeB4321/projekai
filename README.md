These projects focus on data analysis, retrieval, and transformation using Python. They include:

Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup.

API Data Retrieval: Fetching and processing data from REST APIs.

Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Using Pandas for data wrangling.

🔹 C Projects

These projects are part of my Harvard CS50 coursework and cover:

Algorithms & Data Structures: Implementations of sorting, searching, and other core CS concepts.

Memory Management: Understanding pointers, dynamic memory, and efficient coding practices.

Small CLI Applications: Hands-on coding challenges from the CS50 curriculum.

🔹 SQL Projects

These projects include:

SQL Queries & Data Analysis: Writing complex queries for data extraction and insights.

Database Design & Normalization: Structuring relational databases efficiently.

Harvard CS50 SQL Assignments: SQL-based problem-solving tasks.

💡 Technologies Used
