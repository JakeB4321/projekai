ðŸš€ Projects Overview

ðŸ”¹ Python Projects

These projects focus on data analysis, retrieval, and transformation using Python. They include:
Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites using BeautifulSoup.
Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Using Pandas for data wrangling.

ðŸ”¹ C Projects

These projects are part of my Harvard CS50 coursework and cover:
Algorithms & Data Structures: Implementations of sorting, searching, and other core CS concepts.
Memory Management: Understanding pointers, dynamic memory, and efficient coding practices.
Small CLI Applications: Hands-on coding challenges from the CS50 curriculum.

ðŸ”¹ Vilnius Coding School SQL Project

Project includes:
SQL Queries & Data Analysis: Writing complex queries for data extraction and insights.
Database Design & Normalization: Structuring relational databases efficiently.

ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, BeautifulSoup)
